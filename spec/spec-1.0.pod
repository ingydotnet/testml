=head1 TestML

A Software Testing Meta Language. Version 1.0.

=head1 Overview

B<TestML> is a meta language for writing tests that define how a piece
of software should behave, regardless of what programming language that
software is written in.

It is primarily intended for generic libraries or modules that are
relevant in many languages, or that have multiple implementations in the
same language. In these scenarios, the different implementations all use
the exact same tests. However, TestML's clarity and ease of use may make
it desirable for testing all types of software.

TestML documents define a set of data points and a very abstract set of
transformations that turn one set of points to match the expected result
point. Here is a very simple example:

    testml: 1.0
    input.uppercase() == output
    === Test mixed case string
    --- input: I Like Pie
    --- output: I LIKE PIE

In this case, a programmer of any given language would do the following:

=over

=item * Implement a library "Foo" that can turn strings to upper case.

=item * Implement a TestML "bridge class" that defines the 'uppercase'
transform to invoke the Foo upper casing facility.

=item * Set up their test environment to use TestML to run the test.

=head1 History

The concept of TestML was heavily inspired by Ward Cunningham's B<FIT>
test framework. The primary difference is that FIT's test documents are
table/spreadsheet based, where TestML's are text file based. This belies
the premise that FIT caters to business application development (where
spreadsheets are heavily used), and TestML caters to open source library
authors (where everything is in text files).

The specifics of TestML, and the data format specifically, evolved
directly from Ingy döt Net's Perl data-driven testing framework,
Test::Base. Test::Base was written in 2004 and later ported to
JavaScript. As Ingy ported various libraries to other languages, he
realized the potential value of having the test suites be reusable.

=head1 Design Goals

TestML has the following Design Goals:

=over

=item Platform Agnostic

TestML strives to make no assumptions about the programming language,
environment, or testing framework it will be used in. In this way, the exact
same corpus of test documents can be used against multiple implementations
of equivalent software.

=item Ease of Implementation

TestML is designed to be fairly easy to implement in various programming
languages.

The TestML project has a set of tests (written in TestML) that a TestML
implementation must pass to be compliant. See L<http://testml.org/tests/>.

=item Readability

TestML lets you define tests that are both easy for you and others to
write, read and maintain. The format is intended to let the data points
and test conditions be very clear, while hiding the details of
implementation in the I<bridge class>.

=item Extensibility

TestML has been designed with the acknowledgement that it will need to
evolve to meet many various testing requirements. For this reason, every
document requires a TestML version number. Also the original grammar has
been made quite strict, leaving a lot of room for future extension.

=head1 Terminology

TestML uses a number of specific terms. This glossary lists and defines their
meanings.

=over

=item Assertion

A I<test assertion> is a statement in the I<TestML document> that
compares two I<data points> using a I<testing operator>, after they have
been passed through a set of I<data transforms>.

=item Block

A I<data block> is an object that contains a set of named I<data
points>. The block usually has a short description phrase. When the
tests are run, the I<runner class> will run each of the I<test
assertions> against each of the I<data blocks> that contains the I<data
points> needed by the assertion.

=item Bridge

Every test setup defines a class that connects named transformations to
the software being tested. This is known as a I<bridge class>, because
it bridges the test to the application or library.

=item Document

A I<TestML document> is a file containing some number of I<test
assertions> and I<data blocks>. This specification describes the format
of such a document.

=item Meta

A I<TestML document> can define any number of key/value pairs which are
considered I<meta data> and are used to instantiate a I<meta object>
that the test code can later access.

=item Operator

A I<testing operator> is a method that compares the final state of
two data points. The only operator currently currently defined by
TestML is the '==' operator, which compares two unicode strings for
an exact match.

=item Point

A I<data point> is a named piece of data that belongs to a given I<data
block>. All data points are assumed to start out as unicode strings,
although a I<data transform> may turn them into anything else.

=item Section

Every I<TestML document> has two sections, a I<head section> and a
I<data section>. The former specifies I<meta information> and the I<test
assertions> that the document is declaring. The latter section defines
the I<data blocks> against which the test assertions are applied.

=item Transform

A I<transform> is a method provided by a I<bridge class> that changes a
I<data point> form one form into another. A transform usually invokes
functionality of the application it is testing. The whole idea of
TestML is that by passing a data point through one or more transforms,
you can make it equivalent to some other data point, which causes the
test to pass.

=back

=head1 The Specification

To simplify the TestML Specification, it is defined as both a I<set of
BNF grammars>, and a I<set of constraints>. The grammars include a I<top level
document grammar> and a separate I<Testml data section grammar>. The data
section is separate, because it may be marked up in any of several syntaxes.

=head2 Top Level Document Grammar

=over

=item document := head-section data-section

A TestML Document consists of 2 sections, a head section followed by a data section.

Here is an example document:

    # TestML document head section includes:
    # Meta statements,
    testml: 1.0
    key1: value1
    # And test assertions.
    foo.upper() == bar
    foo == bar.lower()

    # The data section defines data objects.
    === Test vowels
    --- foo: i ie ie
    --- bar: I IE IE
    === Test consonants
    --- foo
    lk p
    --- bar
    LK P

=item head-section := ( meta-statement | test-statement | include-statement | comment | blank-line )+

The head section contains both general information (meta statements)
about the test document and the definitions of the assertions the test
is declaring (test statements).

The parsing of the head section should instantiate two TestML objects: the
Meta object and the Assertions object.

=item meta-statement := keyword ':' space+ value eol

Meta statements are key/value pairs separated by a colon and whitespace. A
given meta setting may affect the document parsing from that point forward.

=item test-statement := data-transform space+ operator space+ data-transform eol

A test statement is a declaration of a testing operation. A typical statement
looks like:

    input-name.transform1().transform2(arguments) == expected-output-name

=item include-statement := '%include' space+ relative-file-path eol

An include statement causes the named relative file to be read. The file
contents replace the include statement and are immediately parsed.

=item space := SPACE-CHAR | TAB-CHAR

A I<space> token is a normal space character or a tab character.

=item eol := space+ CARRIAGE-RETURN? NEWLINE

The I<eol> token is a Unix or DOS line ending.

=item data-section := testml-data-section | yaml-data-section | json-data-section | xml-data-section

The data section defines a sequence of data objects, each of which consists of
a short description phrase and a set of named data points.

TestML defines a default syntax, but this section can also be specified in
YAML, JSON or XML.

=item testml-data-section := testml-data-block-marker space+ rest

The I<TestML data section> starts when the data block marker is detected at
the beginning of a line and continues to the end of the file. This section is
parsed into I<data block> objects

=item yaml-data-section :=  '---' whitespace rest

=item json-data-section :=  '[' rest

=item xml-data-section :=  '<' rest

=item rest := ANY-CHAR+

The I<rest> token is simply the remainder of the text in the file. The I<data
sections> are all parsed by separate parsers/grammars.
